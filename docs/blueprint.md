## Original User Request:
Design a modern, elegant SaaS web application called AutoArchitect AI, which allows IT companies and developers to generate database designs, SQL code, and ER diagrams from plain-text project requirements. The design should be heavily inspired by HubSpot.com, using a clean, professional layout with generous white space, soft shadows, and a grid-based structure. Use HubSpot’s color system as a reference: primary blue (#2563EB) for calls-to-action and accents, charcoal and cool grays for text (#1F2937, #6B7280), and light backgrounds (#F8FAFC) with pale gray borders (#E5E7EB). Typography should follow HubSpot’s style with Inter or Open Sans as the primary font, large bold headings (32–48px), clean body text (16px), and JetBrains Mono or Fira Code for code blocks.

There should be five pages: a Landing Page that clearly explains the product with a headline, subheadline, “Try It Free” CTA, feature section, how-it-works steps, testimonials, and a FAQ section; a Login and Signup Page with a two-column layout (visual on the left, form on the right) styled with card-like containers and soft borders; a Dashboard Page featuring a left sidebar with a logo and nav links, a top header with a welcome message and logout button, and a main section with a “Submit Project Requirements” title, a large textarea, optional file upload input, and a blue “Generate” button, followed by card components listing previous generations; and a Results Page that has a top bar with a page title and export/download buttons, followed by a side-by-side layout—left side displaying SQL code in a dark-themed monospaced code block, and the right side showing a placeholder for the ER diagram inside a white, bordered card with export/zoom options.

The overall tone should reflect a trustworthy, enterprise-level tool that is still approachable for developers. Prioritize responsiveness, consistent padding, elegant spacing, and a refined visual hierarchy throughout. The UI should feel like something built for serious work, but still fast, beautiful, and enjoyable to use.
